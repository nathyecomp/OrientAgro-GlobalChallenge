## Project summary

### The issue we are hoping to solve

Orientagro aims to tackle the inefficiencies and environmental impact of traditional soil and gas emission management in agriculture. By providing real-time data on soil conditions and greenhouse gas emissions like nitrous oxide, methane, and CO2, we aspire to promote sustainable farming practices and contribute to climate change mitigation. This will allow farmers to optimize their use of resources like water and fertilizers, thus improving productivity while reducing environmental harm.

### How our technology solution can help

OrientAgro's AI-powered portable sensors offer real-time soil and gas emission analysis for sustainable agriculture.

### Our idea

The existing state of agricultural practices in both the United States and Brazil presents multifaceted challenges. One of the most pressing is the harmful emissions of greenhouse gases like nitrous oxide (N2O), primarily arising from the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, agriculture accounts for a significant portion of N2O emissions, with similar trends observed in Brazil. These emissions contribute notably to the depletion of the ozone layer and global warming. Additionally, traditional soil analysis methods in both countries are slow, costly, and dependent on external labs, employing chemicals that pose their own environmental hazards.

To address these challenges, OrientAgro has developed an innovative technology solutionâ€”a portable, AI-powered sensor system that provides real-time monitoring of soil health and emitted gases. Our device is equipped with an array of sensors capable of analyzing critical soil parameters and detecting gases such as nitrous oxide, methane, and CO2. Unlike existing methodologies, which are manual and dependent on laboratory-based measurements, our solution leverages artificial intelligence to provide immediate, precise data.

The AI algorithms process the real-time data to identify patterns and anomalies, thereby empowering farmers with actionable insights for quick and informed decision-making. This is crucial for understanding the short-term fluctuations in greenhouse gas emissions and offers a comprehensive view of a farm's environmental impact.

The absence of harmful reagents in our analytical process also offers a more sustainable alternative to traditional soil testing methods. It eliminates the logistics and hazards related to transporting soil samples and chemicals, further enhancing the system's sustainability.

In summary, OrientAgro's multi-faceted solution not only addresses the issue of greenhouse gas emissions but also revolutionizes conventional, inefficient soil analysis methods. By employing artificial intelligence, we are adding a layer of smart decision-making to the farming process. Our technology promises to bring about a significant shift towards more responsible and efficient farming practices. It aligns perfectly with initiatives aimed at sustainability and climate resilience, making a substantial contribution to mitigating the effects of climate change and environmental degradation.

1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.
